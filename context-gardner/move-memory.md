Move a section of memory from one memory file to another. Typically used to push context down from the root CLAUDE.md into a subdirectory CLAUDE.md, a .claude/rules/ file, a subagent in .claude/agents/, or the project's auto memory (~/.claude/projects/.../memory/).

## Step 0: Load state

1. Check whether `--all` or the bare word `all` appears anywhere in `$ARGUMENTS`. If found, strip it from the arguments and set the **all-files** flag.
2. Read `.claude/context-gardner-state.json`. If it does not exist, contains invalid JSON, or has an unknown `version`, treat this as a first run (equivalent to `--all`). Warn the user if the file was corrupt or had an unknown version.
3. If the state file has no `version` field or `version` is 1, treat it as needing migration — hashes will be computed during the state update step.
4. Extract `last_invoked` from the state file.
5. When building the memory map (if needed), detect changes using content-hash + mtime:
   - **Fast path**: Compare the file's filesystem mtime against `last_invoked`. If mtime is older and the file exists in the state `files` map with a `content_hash`, compute the SHA-256 hash of the current content and compare. If hashes match, mark as `[unchanged]`.
   - Annotate files as `[changed]`, `[new]`, or `[unchanged]`.
   - Do NOT hide unchanged files — the user may want to move a section to an unchanged file. Suggest changed files first as likely sources.

## Step 1: Identify the source

If $ARGUMENTS is provided, use it to locate the section and destination. Examples:
- `/move-memory "API error handling" to .claude/agents/api-developer.md`
- `/move-memory "Testing conventions" to src/tests/CLAUDE.md`
- `/move-memory "React patterns" to .claude/rules/frontend/react.md`

If $ARGUMENTS is empty or ambiguous, scan the project for all memory files and show the memory map:

```
## Memory Map

### Root memory
- ./CLAUDE.md (N lines)
- ./CLAUDE.local.md (N lines)

### Auto memory
- ~/.claude/projects/.../memory/MEMORY.md (N lines)
- ~/.claude/projects/.../memory/other.md (N lines)   <- if any

### Subdirectory memory
- ./src/api/CLAUDE.md (N lines)
- ...

### Rules
- ./.claude/rules/general.md (N lines)
- ...

### Subagents
- ./.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md (N lines)
- ...
```

Then ask: "Which file do you want to move a section FROM?"

## Step 2: Select the section to move

Parse the source file into sections (a markdown heading and all content under it until the next heading of the same or higher level). Present a numbered list:

```
## Sections in ./CLAUDE.md

1. [Project Overview] (5 lines)
2. [Build Commands] (8 lines) pinned
3. [API Conventions] (12 lines)
4. [Testing Standards] (9 lines)
5. [React Patterns] (14 lines)
6. [Git Workflow] (6 lines)
```

Then ask: "Which section(s) do you want to move? (number, range like 3-5, or comma-separated like 3,5)"

## Step 3: Choose the destination

Ask: "Where should this section go?"

Offer these shortcuts alongside any file path:

- **subdir <path>** — move to a CLAUDE.md in the specified subdirectory (e.g., `subdir src/api` -> `src/api/CLAUDE.md`)
- **rule <name>** — move to a rules file (e.g., `rule frontend/react` -> `.claude/rules/frontend/react.md`)
- **agent <name>** — move to a subagent file (e.g., `agent code-reviewer` -> `.claude/agents/code-reviewer.md`)
- **memory** — move to the project's auto memory file (`~/.claude/projects/.../memory/MEMORY.md`)
- **new <path>** — create a brand new file at the specified path

Or I can type any relative file path directly.

## Step 4: Choose placement within the destination

If the destination file already exists and has content, show its current section headings:

```
## Existing sections in .claude/agents/code-reviewer.md

1. [frontmatter]
2. [Review Checklist]
3. [Severity Levels]
```

Then ask: "Where should the moved section be placed?"

- **top** — after frontmatter (if any), before all other content
- **bottom** — at the end of the file
- **after <N>** — after a specific existing section (e.g., `after 2`)
- **replace <N>** — replace an existing section with the moved content

If the destination file does not exist, it will be created with the moved section as its initial content.

## Step 5: Handle the source

Ask: "What should happen to the original section in the source file?"

- **remove** — delete it entirely from the source
- **replace with reference** — replace it with an @import pointing to the destination (e.g., `See @src/api/CLAUDE.md for API conventions`)
- **keep copy** — leave the original in place (resulting in the section existing in both files)

## Step 5.5: Snapshot before modify

Before applying changes, create a snapshot of all files that will be modified:

1. Resolve the snapshot directory: `~/.claude/projects/<project-key>/memory/.snapshots/`
2. Create a timestamped snapshot folder: `<ISO-timestamp>_move` (e.g., `2026-02-18T12-00-00Z_move`). Use hyphens instead of colons in the timestamp for filesystem compatibility.
3. For each file that will be modified (source and destination), copy its current content into the snapshot folder. Use a path-safe filename: replace `/` with `__` in the relative path (e.g., `./src/api/CLAUDE.md` → `src__api__CLAUDE.md`, `MEMORY.md` stays `MEMORY.md`). Skip files that don't exist yet (new destinations).
4. **Retention**: After creating the new snapshot, check how many snapshot folders exist. If more than 5, delete the oldest ones to keep only 5.

## Step 6: Preview and confirm

Show a side-by-side preview:

```
## Move Preview

### Source: ./CLAUDE.md
BEFORE (lines 18-29):
  ## API Conventions
  - All endpoints return JSON
  - Use standard error envelope
  ...

AFTER:
  See @src/api/CLAUDE.md for API conventions

### Destination: ./src/api/CLAUDE.md
BEFORE: [new file] or [existing content summary]

AFTER:
  [existing content...]

  ## API Conventions
  - All endpoints return JSON
  - Use standard error envelope
  ...

### Impact
- Source: N lines -> M lines (delta)
- Destination: N lines -> M lines (delta)
```

Ask: "Apply this move?"

- If I say yes, first create the snapshot (Step 5.5), then apply the changes to both files.
- If I say no, ask what to adjust.
- After applying, confirm with the final line counts for both files.

### Audit log

After applying, append one JSONL entry per moved section to `~/.claude/projects/<project-key>/context-gardner-audit.log`:

```jsonl
{"timestamp":"<ISO 8601 UTC>","command":"move-memory","action":"move","file":"<source path>","section":"<heading>","destination":"<dest path>","source_action":"<remove|reference|keep>","reason":"User-initiated move","lines_moved":<N>}
```

If the log exceeds 500 lines, trim the oldest entries to bring it back to 500.

## Rules

- Never modify any file until I give explicit approval in Step 6.
- If the destination directory doesn't exist, create it.
- If moving to a subagent that doesn't exist yet, scaffold the file with a minimal YAML frontmatter (name and description derived from the section being moved, tools set to Read only) and ask me to review the frontmatter before applying.
- If moving to a rules file, ask whether to add a `paths:` frontmatter scope. Suggest a sensible default based on the destination path.
- Preserve any pin markers on the section being moved — if it was pinned in the source, it stays pinned in the destination.
- If multiple sections are selected, process them as a single batch move (all go to the same destination, previewed together).
- Always create a snapshot before applying changes (Step 5.5).
- After applying the move, update `.claude/context-gardner-state.json`:
  - Set `version` to `2`.
  - Set `last_invoked` to the current ISO 8601 UTC timestamp.
  - For each modified file:
    - Compute the SHA-256 hash of the file's current content.
    - Update `files` entries with `updated_at` to now, `updated_by` to `"move-memory"`, and `content_hash` to `"sha256:<hex>"`.
    - Add `created_at` for new entries.
  - For section-level tracking: remove moved sections from source file's `sections` map. Add them to destination file's `sections` map with `last_verified` set to now and `review_count` set to `0`.
  - Remove entries for files that no longer exist on disk.
  - Do NOT modify `agent_router_tracking`.
- Never show `.claude/context-gardner-state.json` or `context-gardner-audit.log` as a memory file.
